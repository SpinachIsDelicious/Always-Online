I don't encourage self bots and anything included in the video and the code.
I am displaying this video on an alt account (alternate account)

Firstly, install the "flask" module as shown in the video.

Secondly, make an environment variable.
On windows, make a .env file and show the token in the format below
TOKEN=yourtoken

On Linux (Replit is Linux), click the Lock on the left then add a new value.
The key will be "TOKEN" and the value will be your token

Run it and then go to Guide.md
